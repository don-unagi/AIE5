The expense ratio does not include sales loads or brokerage commissions.\u201d\nThe study does not include fees into the SWR calculations. Every additional 1% of fees that you pay per year is an additional 1% of return that you have to get in order to break even vis-a-vis a comparable investment without fees.

With a MER of 2%, you need a return of 9% to match the SWR. If you only get a 7% return over the same period(meaning 3%, after inflation, after fees), you will likely have a SWR lower than 3% since the growth of your money is exponential while the expenses are constant (in inflation adjusted dollars).

So what did I do?  Went to school, on money I saved myself.  Got an Associate degree, a job, then a better job, then they paid for some of my Bachelor\u2019s degree.  And now I just landed another even better job.  Yea I had debt, plenty of it.  But I managed it through working and", "25932410-0b00-47a8-91b4-83cc3d6ffb95": "through working and paying off the highest interest ones first, and not running up a ton in the first place.  Financing a car was such a foreign idea to me 10 years ago (age 19)that I didn\u2019t even know what the word meant.  And now it\u2019s somehow considered normal?  Ugh.  And let\u2019s face it, most successful people had parents pay for their school and living expenses well into their 20\u2019s, and even 30\u2019s.  My point is, yea sh!t is expense\u2026 but it IS possible to get a degree and a good career without being in debt well into your 30\u2019s, you just gotta work harder than the rich kids ever had to or ever will have to, and party less (or more creatively, aka Natty lite, cheap vodka, iced tea mix.. and drive a 10 year old car).", "de45001e-42bb-4699-94a2-99ae3c48049a": "I do agree with you on the latte\u2019s and iphones tho.  Those things matter when you are making less than 20k a year, but not nearly as much as your most major expenses, in any income bracket.  Those are your living expenses, and transportation.  Keep cars for 10+ years, don\u2019t spend more than 1/3 of your income on one in the first place, and make sure it is fuel efficient and reliable.  Maintain it well.  Spend less than 25% take home on your living expenses (PITI and utilities) (maybe 30% in some cases).

I can\u2019t remember many vacations when I was making $8.00 an hour and I had zero debt. I had to get married to get out of 13K in credit card debt, but I did it in one year.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Comments", "5ed71d61-265b-43b1-a067-8c54912bdc42": "Next Comments\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\nTo keep things non-promotional, please use a real name or nickname(not Blogger @ My Blog Name)\nThe most useful comments are those written with the goal of learning from or helping out other readers \u2013 after reading the whole article and all the earlier comments.
