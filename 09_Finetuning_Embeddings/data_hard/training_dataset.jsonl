food at the potluck buffet. In my area, there seems to be a friendly competition among the thirtysomething outdoorsy tech worker\u00a0crowd, of trying to out-chef each other. It\u2019s a contest I heartily approve of and I am happy to be both an underdog competitor and a judge.\nAnyway, the topic turned to how good we have it in our lives, with such plentiful food that we can afford to spend hours combining exotic ingredients just for the sake of overfilling our bellies.\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I know it\u2019s a bit over the top\u201d, I said, \u201cbut we probably spend 80 bucks a week on good groceries. I think it\u2019s worth it if you can afford it\u201d.", "2edcc4a7-0067-482f-b239-1deea366aa15": "\u201cEighty dollars a week on food for the three of you? That\u2019s IT??\u201d, said a friend, \u201cWe spend more than three times that amount!!\u201d\n\u201cWhoa\u201d, I replied, \u201cI guess I\u2019m not as spendy as I thought\u201d.\nOf course, the person telling me about her high food bill was more of a typical high-income spender in many ways. Her family also took out loans to buy new cars, had at least one $2500 carbon fiber road bike gleaming in the garage, and hired out the household chores to allow them to conveniently work a double-career-with-kids while still taking plenty of short vacations involving air travel. Looking back, I probably could have predicted a non-Mustachian grocery bill.", "3fed2d3c-e4fa-4eec-abcd-d7ecab688d36": "But the experience still reminded me of the amazing variety of spending levels we all have available to us here in the United States. It is simultaneously one of the cheapest industrialized countries in the world to live in, and the most expensive.\u00a0It all depends on the choices you make in your shopping, because everything in the world is available right here for your buying convenience.", "ddf91937-bc96-4824-854b-cc5f5968391f": "When you look it up, the average food cost for a family of four in the US is way up there at the level of my friends, at $944 per month. But to call it \u201cfood cost\u201d makes it sound like it\u2019s out of your control. I would call this the average food spending. Just like the average family\u2019s transportation cost is not some fixed punishment that the cruel world imposes on them\u2026 it\u2019s a measure of the amount of driving\u00a0that they have designed into their lives, multiplied by the level of inefficiency of the vehicles they have chosen for themselves.\nInstead of shooting for the average, you can design your own food spending.", "01744445-dc65-4aa7-a840-aed4ae66ef61": "Let\u2019s say a family of four wants to spend only $365 per month on groceries, saving them $579 per month over that USDA average family in the link above. Investing this savings would compound into about $102,483.00 every ten years, which would obviously make a pretty big improvement in the financial health of the average young family.\nTo hit a monthly grocery spending target like that, you first have to understand what you are buying. There are four mouths to feed, each consuming three meals a day or 91.25 meals per month. Let\u2019s say they all need adult levels of calories, so about 2000 per day.", "e81ff6c6-29dc-48e8-acde-eb6a8c6783f3": "To meet this level of grocery spending, each meal needs average out to about $1.00 per person, and provide about 667 calories. Of course, there can be plenty of variation in the cost and calories, and you might eat 6 smaller meals and snacks instead of three big 667 calorie blasters. But these are the fundamental numbers we\u2019d need to hit.\nCan it be done? Coincidentally, this is about the level of my own grocery spending when I\u2019m in semi-frugal mode (if you scale it down to 3 people and $273/month), and in the non-frugal mode mode we currently shop in, we spend closer to $365/month for three people, resulting in a cost per meal of $1.33. So the answer is a definite Yes.", "31f86f07-4954-4d64-8fd4-9468a6c1337e": "All of us eat very well, with a fair amount of luxury spending thrown into that amount \u2013 the grocery spending includes gourmet coffee every day, a lot of organic and gluten-free specialties, food for parties, and other things that you buy when you\u2019re not worried about cashflow at all. Plus I consume far more than my share of calories due to all-bike transportation and physical labor, my son is growing about six inches a year, and Mrs. Money Mustache does crossfit workouts three times a week, increasing her food needs as well.\n\u201cBut damn, a buck for a whole meal?\u201d, you might say. \u201cThat\u2019s the price of a shitty Burger King dollar menu mini burger on a soggy white bun \u2013 BEFORE TAX!\u201d", "3ee69012-d1ac-478a-b91c-5de6ef685e86": "Luckily, I don\u2019t eat at Burger King, and neither should you.

Although not all of the foods above cost less than $1 per meal, they can certainly average out to less than that, depending on how you combine them.\u00a0And when planning your menu to meet a certain budget, averaging out is exactly your goal. You still want to be able to eat apples, organic chicken breast, or whatever your heart desires. You just have to not eat entirely\u00a0those most expensive foods.\nAnd remember, this $1.00 target is just something I picked out of a hat for an example \u2013 you\u2019re allowed to spend whatever works for you.", "72325d9c-4ee4-4723-909d-bfcf32659de1": "Whole oils are the ultimate example. They are packed with tasty, slow-metabolizing calories, extremely good for you, and easy to mix into your diet. Using olive oil as an example, you can one third of a day worth of calories for 57 cents. Every time you dump these oils into a frying pan, or mix them into a recipe or a salad dressing, you\u2019re lowering your food cost \u2013 the oil provides calories that your body might otherwise get from cans of Coke, Filet Mignon, or Burger King dollar menu burgers.", "807ca4fa-6f4f-439a-8e26-5246aefcf351": "And contrary to the 1990s low-fat-diet fad, the human body loves oil. It\u2019s yummy, clean-burning, good for a giant range of body functions, and it is satisfying to eat too. I eat a fairly high-fat/low-carb diet these days, yet I\u2019m leaner than ever, because the oily food doesn\u2019t cause spikes of fake appetite like bread does. I\u2019ve even been known to bring containers of herb-infused olive oil on road trips, supplementing every meal with this supercharger nutrient, especially when it\u2019s time for an extreme hike or a high-energy work day.\nSee Article: The Amazing Waist-Slimming, Wallet-Fattening Nutrient", "cc8cb8ff-2f3b-45ec-892f-3438efea3dd4": "Similarly, you can mix other foods from the under-$1.00 list into meals, freeing up space for expensive garnishes. Chicken and rice recipes with oils, spices, and vegetables are delicious and can be made in many different styles (Asian, \u00a0Mediterranean, Indian, Mexican) while still coming in at under $1/meal.\nFor snacking, I usually eat handfuls of roasted almonds and other mixed nuts, combined with fresh fruits and vegetables. The nuts provide most of the calories, while the fruits provide the various nutrients and healthy stuff.\nBut What about Protein?", "f9e5b979-04ac-4a6b-bccd-69b15c97e566": "These days, the high-protein diet is back in style, especially among followers of the \u201cPaleo\u201d diet/religion. \u00a0I am also a big fan of the nutrient, since it\u2019s handy as part of strength training and exercise. Unfortunately, most people equate \u201cprotein\u201d with \u201cmeat\u201d, which is the most expensive way to get protein by any measure.\nAn average person might want to shoot for about 75 grams of protein per day, while an athlete might consume 150 grams. As a fairly regular weightlifter and manual-laborer, I go for the higher number myself.", "11ffdda0-c370-4aff-b25b-015b156f43ef": "When you eat beans and rice in the same meal, you\u2019re getting complete protein at virtually no cost. Nuts and especially peanut butter are also a good way to mix high calories with built-in protein. Eggs\u00a0contain the highest quality complete protein of all (6 grams per egg), so I enjoy three of them every day.", "b9db4f67-a504-4c00-9f3d-66170ed4f366": "Protein from high-quality meat and fish costs about 4 cents per gram, which would already put the Paleo-eating athlete over $6.00 per day just for his meat intake. Eggs come in around the same protein cost, although at lower environmental cost and with a lot of good calories and other nutrients as a side benefit.\u00a0But plain old milk, or whey protein powder from Costco, Sam\u2019s Club or an online source like Swanson Vitamins\u00a0provides protein at about 2.5 cents/gram\u00a0\u2013 cutting the bill by 40%. So to hit my own 150 grams during a period of heavier training, I include the eggs, nuts, cheese, a lunch or dinner that includes some meat or fish, and throw in a mid-morning protein shake (banana, milk, yogurt, whey protein powder, pure cocoa and maybe", "3f4e0d04-a735-4861-a6c9-67d820adf1bc": "cocoa and maybe some ground flax or whatever is lying around) for an extra 40 grams of protein.", "cd34d8d9-a5cb-499f-95dc-da7670737aef": "The key is to look at the protein content already in your basic staples before deciding how much you need to supplement it, and then do so intelligently based on your own activity level.\u00a0The average American diet is actually quite oversupplied with protein, due to the fact that most people eat meat with every meal, even while most are not competitive weight-training athletes. The opportunity for savings is enormous.\nWhere to Get your Food\nNot Here", "46a25cbc-f76f-4177-bb7b-80e04251cc09": "Not Here\nTo research this article, I biked over to the health food store in my town, a place called Natural Grocers that attempts to imitate Whole Foods.

In one quick tour of the store, I observed a package of four \u00a0\u201cBison hotdogs\u201d priced at $11.85, a two-pound bag of plain Tilapia filets at $25.00, and jugs of organic milk at $11.00 per gallon.", "009eab80-b027-44e5-ab3e-1e0cd2d1674d": "All of these prices are more than double the levels of the nearest\u00a0Costco, which is one of the best places to shop for your calories and protein, unless you have even better options in your area.

Since the performance of stocks is statistical in nature, you\u2019re shifting your savings rate so far upwards that you can cover even the worst possible case in history. If we insisted on 100% safety in air or car travel, or even walking, we could never do any of those things. I\u2019d probably think of 80-90% as not overly risky myself. Or 100% success rate, but put some hefty adjustments into Firecalc such as always decreasing spending in the event of a down market.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\njlcollinsnh\nMay 30, 2012, 2:13 pm", "2ca2f54b-86c3-4b67-835e-ba30debcef59": "This is an incredibly important point.\nRisk cannot be completely eliminated and trying is a fool\u2019s mission.
