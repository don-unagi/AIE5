food at the potluck buffet. In my area, there seems to be a friendly competition among the thirtysomething outdoorsy tech worker\u00a0crowd, of trying to out-chef each other. It\u2019s a contest I heartily approve of and I am happy to be both an underdog competitor and a judge.\nAnyway, the topic turned to how good we have it in our lives, with such plentiful food that we can afford to spend hours combining exotic ingredients just for the sake of overfilling our bellies.\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I know it\u2019s a bit over the top\u201d, I said, \u201cbut we probably spend 80 bucks a week on good groceries. I think it\u2019s worth it if you can afford it\u201d.", "2edcc4a7-0067-482f-b239-1deea366aa15": "\u201cEighty dollars a week on food for the three of you? That\u2019s IT??\u201d, said a friend, \u201cWe spend more than three times that amount!!\u201d\n\u201cWhoa\u201d, I replied, \u201cI guess I\u2019m not as spendy as I thought\u201d.\nOf course, the person telling me about her high food bill was more of a typical high-income spender in many ways. Her family also took out loans to buy new cars, had at least one $2500 carbon fiber road bike gleaming in the garage, and hired out the household chores to allow them to conveniently work a double-career-with-kids while still taking plenty of short vacations involving air travel. Looking back, I probably could have predicted a non-Mustachian grocery bill.", "3fed2d3c-e4fa-4eec-abcd-d7ecab688d36": "But the experience still reminded me of the amazing variety of spending levels we all have available to us here in the United States. It is simultaneously one of the cheapest industrialized countries in the world to live in, and the most expensive.\u00a0It all depends on the choices you make in your shopping, because everything in the world is available right here for your buying convenience.", "ddf91937-bc96-4824-854b-cc5f5968391f": "When you look it up, the average food cost for a family of four in the US is way up there at the level of my friends, at $944 per month. But to call it \u201cfood cost\u201d makes it sound like it\u2019s out of your control. I would call this the average food spending. Just like the average family\u2019s transportation cost is not some fixed punishment that the cruel world imposes on them\u2026 it\u2019s a measure of the amount of driving\u00a0that they have designed into their lives, multiplied by the level of inefficiency of the vehicles they have chosen for themselves.\nInstead of shooting for the average, you can design your own food spending.", "01744445-dc65-4aa7-a840-aed4ae66ef61": "Let\u2019s say a family of four wants to spend only $365 per month on groceries, saving them $579 per month over that USDA average family in the link above. Investing this savings would compound into about $102,483.00 every ten years, which would obviously make a pretty big improvement in the financial health of the average young family.\nTo hit a monthly grocery spending target like that, you first have to understand what you are buying. There are four mouths to feed, each consuming three meals a day or 91.25 meals per month. Let\u2019s say they all need adult levels of calories, so about 2000 per day.", "e81ff6c6-29dc-48e8-acde-eb6a8c6783f3": "To meet this level of grocery spending, each meal needs average out to about $1.00 per person, and provide about 667 calories. Of course, there can be plenty of variation in the cost and calories, and you might eat 6 smaller meals and snacks instead of three big 667 calorie blasters. But these are the fundamental numbers we\u2019d need to hit.\nCan it be done? Coincidentally, this is about the level of my own grocery spending when I\u2019m in semi-frugal mode (if you scale it down to 3 people and $273/month), and in the non-frugal mode mode we currently shop in, we spend closer to $365/month for three people, resulting in a cost per meal of $1.33.

High income (and savings rate) people that hire a house cleaner and claim their time is better spent at work than cleaning their house are wrong.", "55feeb29-d724-48a6-aa3a-da07ba5aaed6": "McDuffy\nAugust 22, 2014, 10:48 am\n\n\nGood point on the ratio while in the saving phase. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that if you plan to retire on this logic, the higher your savings rate, the smaller your nest egg and the more important controlling your retirement cost. If you ever have a bad year and need to dip into principle, the extra $10,000 of principal loss becomes much more dire for the person who retired on only $500k because they assumed a $20k annual cost and a 4% safe withdrawal rate. \nRetiring on $500k is not necessarily good or bad (it may actually be good cause it means you\u2019re extremely frugal!), but it does increase certain risks not immediately obvious in the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Comments", "e9f60ae7-0dab-4e99-93ce-281396ec28ba": "Next Comments\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\nTo keep things non-promotional, please use a real name or nickname(not Blogger @ My Blog Name)\nThe most useful comments are those written with the goal of learning from or helping out other readers \u2013 after reading the whole article and all the earlier comments.

But for now, for those new to the concept, let\u2019s define the Safe Withdrawal Rate:\n\nThe Safe Withdrawal Rate is the maximum rate at which you can spend your retirement savings, such that you don\u2019t run out in your lifetime.", "59884da3-c33d-4551-966c-a2f695fec8c3": "That sounds nice and simple, but many people consider it an unpredictable thing to nail down. \nAfter all, you don\u2019t know what sort of rollercoaster rides the economy will take your retirement savings on, and you also don\u2019t know what rate of inflation will persist through your lifetime. Will a box of eggs cost $6.00 a dozen when you\u2019re 65, or will it be closer to $60? So how can we possibly know how much money we will need to live on in retirement?\nThe answers you get to this question vary widely. \nFinancial beginners (about 95% of the population) tend to randomly just throw out a number between 5-100 million dollars.", "06d5df03-5c6f-4fe5-b6bd-42910d5e1d0e": "Financial advisers who aren\u2019t Mustachians will tell you that it depends on your pre-retirement income, (with the implicit assumption that you are spending most of what you earn) and the end answer will be somewhere between 2 and 10 million.\nFinancial Independence enthusiasts will have the closest-to-correct answer: Take your annual spending, and multiply it by somewhere between 20 and 30. That\u2019s your retirement number.\n If you use the number 25, you\u2019re implicitly using a 4% Safe Withdrawal Rate, which is my own personal favorite number.\nSo where does this magic number come from?", "5cff9547-d7a2-451a-99d3-51bdefb05314": "At the most basic level, you can think of it like this: imagine you have your \u2018stash of retirement savings invested in stocks or other assets. They pay dividends and appreciate in price at a total rate of 7% per year, before inflation. Inflation eats 3% on average, leaving you with 4% to spend reliably, forever.\nI can already hear a chorus of whines and rattling keyboards starting up, so let\u2019s qualify that statement. I admit it: that is the idealized and simplified version.", "1b84cd50-4d1b-4d33-809e-0360946327b1": "In reality, stocks go up and down every year, and so does inflation. Over a long multi-decade period like the gigantic retirement you and I will be enjoying, enormous things have happened in the past. The Great Depression. The World Wars, Vietnam, and the Cold War. The abandonment of the gold standard for US currency and years of 10%+ inflation and 20%+ interest rates. More recently, the great financial crash and a slicing in half of of real estate and stock values.", "1f4192b5-2fdc-4fb2-bd7e-9608c815b43f": "If you happened to retire in 1921 on a mostly-stock nest egg, you would have experienced an enormous stock run-up for the first eight years of your retirement. You\u2019d be so rich by the time the 1929 crash and the Great Depression hit, that you\u2019d barely notice the trouble in the streets from your rosewood-paneled tea room.\nOn the other hand, if you retired in early 2000 while holding stocks, you saw an immediate and huge drop in your savings along with low dividend yields \u2013 and your \u2018stash may be have had some scary times in the early days, and again around 2009. Would you still have any money left today?", "7ae577cd-2b88-4cf5-b512-e8d2c0f3676b": "In other words \u2013 the sequencing of booms and crashes matters. Ideally, you want to reach your magic retirement number in a time of nice, reasonable stock prices, just before the start of another long boom so that your retirement starts off on a good foot. But you can\u2019t predict these things in advance. So again, how do we find the right answer?\nLuckily, various Early Retirement Ninjas have done the work for us. They analyzed what would have happened\u00a0for a hypothetical person who spent 30 years in retirement between the years 1925-1955. then 1926-1956, 1927-1957, and so on.", "6bf6db60-233e-4331-861a-c7125ee256a4": "They gave this imaginary retiree a mixture of 50% stocks and 50% 5-year US government bonds, a fairly sensible asset allocation. Then they forced the retiree to spend an ever-increasing amount of his portfolio each year, starting with an initial percentage, then indexed automatically to inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nThis simple but important series of calculations was called the Trinity Study, \u00a0and since then it has been updated, tweaked, and reported on, and it\u2019s still the subject of lots of debate today. Wade Pfau is one reasonable voice in the industry, and he created the following useful chart showing what the maximum safe withdrawal rate would have been for various retirement years:", "cfaf18e9-38ee-4a8d-8a39-ff1b93b28cd2": "As you can see, the 4% value is actually somewhat of a worst-case scenario in the 65 year period covered in the study. In many years, retirees could have spent 5% or more of their savings each year, and still ended up with a growing surplus.\nThis brings me to a critical point: this study defines \u201csuccess\u201d as not going broke during a 30-year test period. To people like you and me who will enjoy 60-year retirements, that would not be successful \u2013 we want our money to last much longer than 30 years.", "df1b1bdf-e63c-48a5-a490-582fc475328f": "Luckily, the math in this case is pretty interesting: there is very little difference between a 30-year period, and an infinite year period, when determining how long your money will last. It\u2019s much like a 30-year mortgage, where almost all of your payment is interest. Drop your payment by just $199 per month, and suddenly you\u2019ve got a thousand-year mortgage that will literally take you 1000 years to pay off. Increase the payment by a few hundred, and you have a fifteen year payoff!\nIn other words, above 30 years, the length of your retirement barely affects the safe withdrawal rate calculations.\nSo far, we\u2019re liking the 4% rule quite a bit, right? But yet whenever I mention it, I get complaints. Let\u2019s review a few of them:", "8b93caf2-1654-4704-8332-b7fb8556b867": "The trinity study is based on a prosperity anomaly: the United States during its boom years.

How will this all look after Peak Oil hits us!?You can\u2019t take a one-size-fits-all rule and apply it to something as varied as an economy and an individual\u2019s life! My health care costs could go up! Hyperinflation could strike!Even at a 4% withdrawal rate, there\u2019s still a chance of portfolio failure. That means I\u2019ll be flat broke and out on the street in my old age.

In short, we have designed a Safety Margin into our lives that is wider than the average person\u2019s entire retirement plan.\nSo now that we\u2019re feeling good about the 4% rule again, let\u2019s bring the point home:\nFar from being a risky proposition, planning for 4% Safe Withdrawal rate is actually the most conservative method of retirement saving I could possibly recommend.", "6bcf6ed0-57c5-46fc-8174-8fca43ffe42e": "To apply it in real life, just take your annual spending level, and multiply it by 25. That\u2019s how much you need to retire, at the most. A $25,000 spender like me needs $625,000. I\u2019ve got more than that, plus various safety margins in the lifestyle, so all is good.\nWithout undue risk, and as long as you have skills that can be used to earn money eventually in the future (hint: you do), I can even advocate an SWR of 5%. In other words, get your expenses down to $25k, and you can quit your job on $500k or less. Then you can use the methods described in First Retire, then Get Rich to gradually increase your safety margin (and effectively decrease your withdrawal rate) as you age.", "2e17e57a-8914-44c5-b820-a8249d67e3e5": "So there\u2019s no need to debate. 4% is a perfectly good answer, which means 25 times your annual expenses is a perfectly good goal to save for. Along the way, you might find your annual expenses melting away, which makes things ever-more-attainable (as shown in the shockingly simple math behind early retirement post). But worry, you must not.\nAnd if you\u2019re ready to play with the numbers even further, check out the FIREcalc website.
